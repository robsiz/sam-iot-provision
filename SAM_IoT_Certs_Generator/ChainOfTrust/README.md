# Chain of Trust Store

## Purpose

Any file located in this folder will be used to override the corresponding Chain of Trust file that is auto-generated by the provisioning tool.
If this folder does not contain any Chain of Trust files, then the provisioning tool will use all the default mock files that are automatically generated by the provisioning scripts.

## File Naming Conventions

The following file names for each type of Chain-of-Trust component must be used in order for the provisioning scripts to properly recognize the purpose of each file:

- Root Certificate = `root-ca.pem`
- Root Key = `root-ca.key`
- Signer Certificate = `signer-ca.pem`
- Signer Certificate Signing Request (CSR) = `signer-ca.csr`
- Signer Key = `signer-ca.key`
